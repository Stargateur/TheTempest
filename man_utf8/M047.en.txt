#Well! The Dwarves lived in the Cave of the Dwarves in Mount St. Kelly, and the two villages were peaceful until the Dwarven King was killed. After the incident, it was rumored that it was a poisoner under the people in my village, and no one knew who the murderer was, so in order to avoid being blamed, he walked and fled.#

#Who would admit that he was the murderer, who dared to assert without evidence, anyway, the people in our village were killed.#

#To get to the Dwarven Cave to cross the snowy mountain, your only way is to take a boat, after going ashore and heading north, you can see a St. Kelly Hill, there are many dwarven guards, it should be the entrance to the Dwarven Cave.#
