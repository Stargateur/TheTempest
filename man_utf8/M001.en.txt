#Flying cape instruction manual, which was left by ancestors. The book records the method of making a flying cape, and according to the instructions in the manual, you can make a flying cape, wear it and fall from a high place, and be unharmed. Now that the book had been snatched, I chased all the way to the entrance of the whale cave, but I did not dare to go down.#

#Feed! Don't mistake me for being timid, I haven't touched the bottom of Karabang yet, and it's unwise to venture into the whale cave alone, if you have the courage, go on an adventure with me, what do you think?#
