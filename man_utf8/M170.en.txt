#When he announced the rebuilding of the Patnon Temple, my father already had a vague sense that something was wrong, and when we learned that Kate had found the Mana Badge, we almost knew what Kate really wanted. Although the village has been prepared, it is still invincible to Kate's evil magic, but it is all because of the appearance of you, the real magician, that Pleoli is rescued.#
