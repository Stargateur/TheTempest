#Here's the thing... On that day I heard the sound of a fight in the woods while I was on business, and I hid in the grass and saw a monkey-like monster terrorizing the Dwarf King, hoping that he would gather Dwarven soldiers to attack Prosphelo's son, and the Dwarf King refused to take revenge and died under the arrows. * I was about to run away in shock, but I didn't expect to be caught by The Minions of Karabang.#

#Because he wanted me to spread rumors that the Enoch had killed the dwarf king, I would not have agreed, but he threatened to kill my wife and children, and I had no choice but to agree. In fact, these days, my heart is also very painful, and I have always wanted to tell the truth, but ...#

#Never mind... None of this mattered anymore, I would explain the truth to the Dwarf Queen, and I would have no face here, and after the explanation I would leave with my wife and children.#
