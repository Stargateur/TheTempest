#Oh, yes! I've been imprisoned in this dungeon for a long time!#

#Not the mischievous dryads.#
0 28 5 0 2 6 7 #• Why?#
#To thank you for saving me from trouble, I'll tell you! Because I have a mirror book, and that mirror book is the nemesis of the Dryads, and there are ways to make them appear, that's why I'm locked up here.#

#You don't know, the Dryad looks similar to ordinary trees on the surface, and ordinary people can't tell the difference, unless they use the spell of the fire-eyed golden eye in the mirror book to make him appear in its original form.#

#The Dryad forced me to hand over the book, but I would not give it to me when I died, and I hid it in a very secret place. If you're willing to help me deal with the Dryad, I can give you the Mirror Book.#
