#He has always been kind to others, never harsh on the people, rewards and punishments are clear, did not expect the Jenoch people to be so cruel, if the conscription assault can force out the murderer, it is only so.#

#Bailey had just arrived, so I already knew the truth, and Karabang was really vicious, not only killing the Dwarven King, but also provoking peace among the tribes and causing a terrible war, which could be resolved thanks to your keen help. The Dwarf King had a treasure âˆ¼ mysterious ore before he died, and he heard that he could make things lighter, so he gave it to you, which is a heart of the dwarf people for you.#
