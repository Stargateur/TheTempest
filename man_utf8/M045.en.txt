#Yes! As long as you don't mess with it, it won't do anything to you! The cliff is so high and the wind is strong, but it likes to live there, and my mother does not allow me to approach it, saying that it will eat people, how can it be, it is very obedient!#

#It was the grown-ups who didn't let us go there, that's why we said that. I don't like the name "Green Dragon" that people give it, it doesn't sound very comfortable, I still like to call it Babe.#
