#Ariel dances and sings with invisibility , Please come to this yellow sand beach , and then hold your hands again , waiting for you to kiss and salute ∼ The menacing wind and waves also quiet ∼ You must dance lightly to hear the nightingale's chirping, listen! Listen! Do you hear me?#

#A rough man who dreams of power all day long! An ungrateful beast! Alas, I can't think of any kind words to describe him.#
